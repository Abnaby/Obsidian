### Definition 
- Env vars are variables that store info about system 
- It doesn't maintain or store a global set of environment (it is process oriented)
	- shell is a process
	- to list all Env vars of program : by viewing file @
```bash
cat /proc/<pid>/environ # where pid is proccess id 
```
	- to list all proccesses
```bash
ls /proc
```
- List Local and System Var 
```bash
set
```
- List System Var 
```bash
# 1st way
printenv
# 2nd way 
env 
# For Specific Variable 
printenv <variable> #without dollar sign == echo $<variables>
```
### Env Variables can be divided to 
- System Environment Variable 
	- Has standard name 
	- Normally they are All **CAPS** with `_` as separator. 
	- ==Child processes can receive env setting==
- Local Variable
	- User selected names
	- ==Local for shell (Not passed for shell Childs or programs)==
	- try to avoid all CAPS in convention. 
### Example of Usage 
- Configure look of shell such as colors, and bash prompt 
- Time zone, host name, etc... 
- Search path for bin/executables
- Default values of system configuration 
- Some configuration of specific programs 
### How does processes receive System Environment Setting
#### By Inheritance
- Each process will have a parent process (All processes are branched from init process)
- Child process inherits the environment setting of the parent process
- All Local Variable  can't be inherited.
- Example 
	- When Run a script (Child Process) from Shell/Bash (Parent process) 
	- the script can inherit All//Some Env vars from parent Bash
	- Note that "All non-login shell" is a child of a "login shell"

#### By startup scripts 
* Some programs ==`source`== some scripts at start up (source not execute to affect this setting in running shell)
* these scripts may include some of environment variables setting
* Example
	* Login Shell Sequence 
		* `/etc/profile` "For global settings that applied for all users" 
		* that will source one of `~/.bash-profile` or `~/.bash-login` or `~/.profile` for local setting Note that one of them call `~/.bashrc` for Non Login Shell
	* Non Login Shell
		* By inheritance from `Login Shell`
		* then source one of `/etx/.bashrc`, or `/etc/bash.bashrc` # global
		* then start `~/.bashrc` # Local
	* GUI Apps
		* source script ~/.xinitrc "For User Directory"
- Notes
	- For user specific use `~/.bashrc` that will apply on Login and Non-Login Shell
	- For System specific use `/etc/profile` 
		- why not in non login global scripts 
			- Because the Non Login will inherit from Login scrip and we will make sure our changes will be applied on login and non-login shells
#### By pass it as arguments at start
- Syntax 
```bash
env VAR=VALUE Command # It doesn't defined in my shell it will be passed as arguments 
# OR
VAR=VALUE Command
```
- Example 
```bash 
env EDITOR=vim xterm # EDITOR is anvairable in xterm
EDITOR=vim myScript.sh 
```
#### Add it manually
- For Local Variable 
```bash
VARIABLE=VALUE # will applied on current shell only
```
- Env Variable 
```bash
export VARIABLE=VALUE # will be exported for all childs
```
- Example
```bash
export EDITOR=vim # vim as editor will be exported to child process
export -n EDITOR  # will be local variable not environmet
```
### Deeper Look @ `/etc/profile`
- It is a system wise script 
- Doesn't make sense every user need to edit or write some system command use this file.
	- So in most distros it is not preferred to edit `/etx/profile` directly 
	- For that, the `/etc/profile` has a loop that ==sources== all scripts with extensions `*.sh` in folder `/etc/profile.d`
- So to make some scripts 
```bash
touch /etc/profile.d/something.sh # so something.sh will be applied for all users
```
### Common used Env variables 
#### PATH
- List of dirs separated by comma
- For search path for binaries
- to show current search path `
```bash
echo $PATH
```
- Extend PATH variable 
```bash
# @ the end 
export PATH=$PATH:/user/bin
# @ the beginning
export PATH=/bin:${PATH}
```
- for exampleBinaryFile
```bash 
# to seach in path 
exampleBinaryFile # It will search for exampleBinaryFile @ paths in PATH var

# to excute it from local dir
./exampleBinaryFile
```
#### PS1
- For Prompt
```bash
userName@HostName:Home_Dir:~$
```
- for change it 
	- `\u` --> to change userName
	- `\h` --> to change HostName
	- '\W' --> to change Home_Dir to another working dir
- Example
```bash
export PS1[\u@\h \W]\$ # Change format
```
#### DISPLAY
- Each xserver has its own DISPLAY
- it is responsible for X display name 
- it won't be declared in virtual terminal {Like tty1 to tty5}
- Format
```
HOST:DISPLAYNUMBER.SCREEN_NEUMBER
```
	- HOST --> FOR LOCAL HOST (optional)
	- DISPLAYNUMBER --> default is 0 (M)
	- SCREEN_NEUMBER --> DEFAULT 0 WILL BE CAHNGED IF U HAVE MULTIPLE SCREENS IN SAME DISPLAY (optional)
- Example
```bash
echo $DISPLAY # localhost:4 --> HOST = localhost, DISPLAYNUMBER = 0, SCREEN_NEUMBER = 0
```
#### SHELL
- contains the path to the login shell 
```bash
echo $SHELL # /bin/bash
```
#### EDITOR 
- Default Editor 
```bash 
echo $EDITOR # vim for example
```
#### TERM
- Kind of the used terminal 
- Example 
```bash
	echo $TERM # xterm --> For GUI  (Emulated terminal)
	echo $TERM # linux --> For Virtual terminal  
```
#### HOME
- user home directory
