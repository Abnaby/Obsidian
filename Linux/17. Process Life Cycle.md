### 1. Process Creation 
#### Step I : Fork 
* In this step the created process (Child Process) is created and inherits features from parent 
* Includes 
	* Assign new PID
	* Create associate structure in kernel 
	* Sets PPID, PGID, SID and any other attributes. 
	* Add it to Kernel Scheduler 
	* 
#### Step II : Execute 
- Child process separate from its parent and move on with its functionality
- New Memory space instead of its parent.
- Will lose access to parent process resources .
- A pointer to new program to run 
### 2. Process Termination 
#### Process can terminated by 
- Normal Termination (End of the program)
- Receive a signal that cause it to terminate itself 
- Terminated by the kernel
#### Notes 
- After Process terminated, some of its recourses are not yet released So its state changed to ==**Zombie**==
- The parent process must be waiting for its children processes to perform required cleanup of recourses
(فعشان كدا كل بروسيس لازم يكون ليها parent عشان نعرف نعمل cleanup ونخرجها من حاله ال zombie)
### 3. Process States 
- **(R) Running**: The process is currently executing on the CPU.
- **(T) Stopped**: The process has been stopped, usually because it received a signal (ctrl+z).
- **(D) Uninterruptible**: The process is waiting for an event and cannot be interrupted, typically while performing I/O operations.
- **(S) Interruptible**: The process is waiting for an event but can be interrupted by signals or timeout.
- **(Z) Zombie**: The process has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table, often waiting for its parent to read its exit status.

### Process VS Threads 
- In Linux the thread is a process with special difference: 
	- When Create thread, it share same address space with the parent (Process without address space) 
	- Share same resources with its parent
