### Common Wildcards 
1. **Asterisk ( * )**
    - **Usage:** Matches any number of characters, ==including none==.
    - **Example:** `ls *.txt` lists all files ending with `.txt`, like `file1.txt`, `notes.txt`.
2. **Question Mark (?)**
    - **Usage:** Matches exactly ==one character==.
    - **Example:** `ls file?.txt` lists files like `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, but not `file10.txt`.
3. **Square Brackets ([ ])**
    - **Usage:** Matches any one of the enclosed characters.
    - **Example:** `ls file[1-3].txt` lists files like `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt` , but not `file4.txt`..
4. **Caret (!) within Square Brackets**
    - **Usage:** Matches any character not enclosed.
    - **Example:** `ls file[!1-3].txt` lists files like `file4.txt`, `fileA.txt`, but not `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, or `file3.txt`.
5. **\[\[:< calssName >>]]**
    - **Usage:** single char belongs to specific class.
    - **Example:** 
	    - `ls \[[alnum]]` --> (a-z,A-Z,0-9)
		- `ls \[[alpha]]` --> (a-z,A-Z)
		- `ls \[[digit]]` --> (0-9)
		- `ls \[[lower]]` --> (a-z)
		- `ls \[[upper]]` --> (A-Z)
1. **Curly Braces ({ })**
    - **Usage:** Used to specify a comma-separated list of options.
    - **Example:** `ls file{1,2,3}.txt` lists `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`.
1. **Escape Wildcards (\)**
    - **Usage:** Used to treat wildcards as literal characters.
    - **Example:** `ls \*.txt` would list a file literally named `*.txt` instead of treating `*` as a wildcard.
