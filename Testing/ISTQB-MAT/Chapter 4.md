## Development Platforms for Mobile Application 
- These IDEs have various tools that help in designing, coding, compiling, installing, deinstalling, monitoring, emulating, logging and testing apps.
- For example,
	- Android Studio may be used for Android app
	- Xcode may be used for iOS app\
- Some cross-platform development frameworks are also available which helps in the development of mobile applications.
## Common Platform Development Tools 
- Software development kits usually provide various utilities which are helpful in developing and testing applications
	- such as taking screenshots, extracting logs, sending random events and notifications to the device, monitoring various parameters
- Examples 
	- Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager
	- Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
	- Android Device Monitor for Android (Deprecated)
	- Instruments for iOS
## Emulator and Simulator 
- Remote device access (RDA) allows access via a network connection to various devices hosted in the provider’s data center.

| **Definition**                   | Models the _runtime environment_                                                | Models the _hardware_ and uses the _same runtime environment_ as real device |
| **Compilation**                  | App is compiled into a _simulator-specific version_ (not usable on real device) | App is compiled into _real device byte-code_ (same as actual device)         |
| **OS Dependency**                | Independent of real OS                                                          | Same as real OS                                                              |

| **Replacement for Real Devices** | Limited (not byte-code equivalent)                                              | Partially possible (but not full replacement)                                |
| **Limitations**                  | Cannot mimic real device behavior fully; differs at code level                  | May not support touch, accelerometer, etc.; limited by host platform         |
| **Testing Cost Efficiency**      | Low                                                                             | Moderate – used to reduce costs by replacing some devices                    |
| **Common Tools**                 | Often integrated in dev environments                                            | Also integrated; Android Studio, Xcode, ADB for installation                 |
| **Configuration Options**        | Supports usage parameters: GPS, signal strength, orientation, network, etc.     | Same – customizable simulation parameters                                    |
| **Third-Party Availability**     | Available                                                                       | Available                                                                    |
## Setting up Testing Lab
| **Approach**                  | **On-Premise Lab**                                                                    | **Remote Test Lab**                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Location**                  | All devices, emulators, and simulators are kept **on-site**                           | Devices are **hosted remotely** and accessed over a network                             |
| **Device Selection Criteria** | Based on device rank, OS/version, screen specs, features, audience importance         | Same criteria may apply, depending on provider                                          |
| **Advantages**                | - Proximity-based & sensor-specific testing (battery, touch, etc.)- Enhanced security | - Access to unavailable devices/networks- Scalability- Geo-based testing                |
| **Disadvantages**             | - High setup/maintenance cost- Limited flexibility for different locations            | - Slower response time- Limited multi-touch/gesture support- Costly if used extensively |

| **Best Use Case**             | Long-term, in-depth testing, full control of environment                              | Short-term or geographically diverse testing; when local devices are unavailable        |
| **Scalability**               | Limited – fixed setup                                                                 | Highly scalable – grows/shrinks with project needs                                      |
| **Combination**               | Can be used in **combination** with remote labs for optimal test coverage             | Can be used in **combination** with on-premise labs                                     |
