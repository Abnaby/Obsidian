## Automation Approaches
### User Agent Based Testing 
- user-agent identifier string sent by the browser to spoof a particular browser on a particular device.
- This approach can be used for executing mobile web applications.
- Mobile web can be tested using the usual web application automation tools on the desktop
### Device Based Testing
- Running the application under test directly on the device.
- This approach can be used for all types of mobile applications.
- native apps might need specific tools
### Capabilities that a mobile application testing framework
- Object Identification 
- Object Operations 
- Test Reports 
- Application programming interfaces and extendable capabilities
- Documentations 
- Integration with other tools 
- Independent of test development practice

## Automation Tools Evaluation
### Organizational Fit 
Organizational fit parameters are described in chapter 6.2 of the ISTQBÂ® Foundation Level syllabus ISTQB_CTFL_2018.
### Technical Fit
- Test automation requirements and complexities such as the use of new features like FaceID, fingerprint and chatbots by the app.
- Test environment requirements, such as varying network conditions, import or creating test data, and server-side virtualization.
- Test Reporting 
- Integration with other tools.
- Support and Documentation.
## Automation Test Lab
- When reaching a more advanced stage of the app development, teams need to perform full regression test, functional tests, and non-functional tests. These tests are best executed on a full device lab.
- When reaching a more advanced stage of the app development, teams need to perform full regression test, functional tests, and non-functional tests. These tests are best executed on a full device lab.
- Remote device test labs are not always necessary in the later development stages of the app.
- Well designed and maintained on-premise device test labs can be as good as or better than any remote device test lab.
