- by Tester 
### Objective 
- Create test case for each module/function 
- to write test cases tester takes 
	- Requirement (SRC)
	- Design (SWDD)
- Prepare Test data for each test case 

### Output
- Requirement Traceability matrix
	- For: 
		- Change Management 
		- Risk management 
	- Objective of this Matrix 
		- Help me to make impact analysis for any changes 
### Example: Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) Example

| **Requirement ID** | **Requirement Description**                     | **Test Case ID** | **Test Case Description**                                               | **Test Status** | **Comments**        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| RQ_001             | User login functionality with valid credentials | TC_001           | Verify login with valid username and password.                          | Passed          |                     |
| RQ_001             | User login functionality with valid credentials | TC_002           | Verify login attempt with invalid credentials shows error.              | Passed          |                     |
| RQ_002             | Password reset via email                        | TC_003           | Verify password reset email is sent when user clicks 'Forgot Password'. | In Progress     |                     |
| RQ_003             | User account creation                           | TC_004           | Verify that new users can successfully create an account.               | Failed          | Error on validation |
| RQ_004             | User profile update                             | TC_005           | Verify that users can update their profile information.                 | Not Executed    |                     |
| RQ_005             | Multi-factor authentication (MFA)               | TC_006           | Verify that MFA is triggered during login when enabled.                 | Not Executed    |                     |

### Key Components:
- **Requirement ID**: Unique identifier for each requirement, typically from the SRS.
- **Requirement Description**: Brief description of the functionality or feature to be tested.
- **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for each test case.
- **Test Case Description**: Brief description of the specific test case associated with the requirement.
- **Test Status**: Current status of the test case (e.g., Passed, Failed, In Progress, Not Executed).
- **Comments**: Any additional information or notes about the test case or its execution.
