### CH1
- General Test Event --> Bug Hunting
- None Availability of Device/ different geographic locations --> Crowd Testing
- Network not a part pf data analytics 
- Device Portfolio --> Test Plan
- Architecture 
	- Client Side (Thin Client Apps for Browser Based JS Comptablity , Thick/Fat for native and hybrid apps)
	- Server Side (Single Tier (Monolithic), Multi Tier )\
- Connection Type
	- Never/ Partially/ Always Connected 
- Data Sych 
	- Continuous mode 
	- Store and Forward
- Data Transfer 
	- Sync 
	- Asynch
- Use of multiple device --> Market Fragmentation 
- stakeholders --> Developers and Testers, OS Providers, Tools Providers
### CH2
- interoperability of a mobile application and it's co-existence with other apps on the device --> Notification Conflict with Other apps
- platforms interoperability testing --> Backward compatibility, new feature of platform, notification handling 
- Hybrid App --> MORE concern about performance issues and Interactions with device features 
- Charger is a type of interruptions 
- Input Methods --> Long Press, Pinch, Zoom, Swipes
- Not Valid Option Testing connectivity methods --> Ensure that the user always sees his data usage as long as the application is running.
### CH3 
- Performance Testing --> Measure time and Resources Consumption 
- Internationalize Testing --> Date Format 
- Field Testing --> Testing Level not a Type/overcome risks that happen from the expected usage patterns of mobile applications
- App Approval step --> Test Level 
- Mnemonics can be used as heuristic but not vice versa 
- Tours --> Expletory Testing , effective method for field testing
- For Instability --> 
	- Methods : OTA via Wifi and Cellular Data Data Cables
	- Approach Desktop, Sideboarding, Application Stores 
	- Condition installing/Interruption/ Deinstalling
- Performance Testing --> Not Related with Power, tested on the device itself (chronometry)
- Stress --> performance efficiency of the application when subjected to conditions beyond normal load, like High CPU Usage
- **session-based test** --> Issues Investigating and Reporting
- Personas --> Fictional Characters have name age ..
- Usability --> Called Issues not a Bug
