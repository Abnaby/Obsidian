	- ==scalability== and ==deployment== standardization (e.g., virtual machines, containerization tools)
- Any other tool that assists in testing (e.g., a spreadsheet is a test tool in the context of testing)
### Benefits and Risks of Test Automation
#### *Benefits of Test Automation*
1. **Time Savings**: Reduces repetitive manual tasks like executing regression tests and comparing results.
2. **Error Prevention**: Ensures consistency and repeatability, reducing the likelihood of human errors.
3. **Objective Assessment**: Provides measurable data (e.g., coverage) that might be difficult for humans to derive.
4. **Enhanced Test Management**: Easier access to testing information, supporting reporting with statistics, graphs, etc.
5. **Faster Test Execution**: Leads to earlier defect detection, quicker feedback, and reduced time to market.
6. **More Time for Test Design**: Allows testers to focus on designing new and more effective tests.

#### *Risks of Test Automation*:
1. **Unrealistic Expectations**: Misunderstanding the tool's benefits, functionality, or ease of use.
2. **Inaccurate Estimations**: Misjudging the time, costs, and effort needed for tool introduction, script maintenance, and process changes.
3. **Inappropriate Tool Use**: Employing test automation where manual testing would be more effective.
4. **Over-reliance on Tools**: Neglecting the need for human critical thinking.
5. **Vendor Dependency**: Risks associated with the tool vendor (e.g., going out of business, poor support, or tool retirement).
6. **Open-source Challenges**: Potential abandonment or frequent updates required for open-source tools.
7. **Compatibility Issues**: Automation tool not being compatible with the development platform.
8. **Regulatory Compliance**: Selecting a tool that doesnâ€™t meet regulatory or safety standards.
