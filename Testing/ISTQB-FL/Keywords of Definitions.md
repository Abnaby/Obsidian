### Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- ==Fundamental reason== for the occurrence of a problem
### Testware
- created as output ==work products== from the test activities
### Tests wear out.
- ==same tests are repeated many times==, they become ==increasingly ineffective== at detecting new defects
### Risk register
==list of risks== together with risk likelihood, risk impact and information about risk mitigation
### Some of Test Activates tips 
- Test analysis (prioritize ==test conditions==)
- Test design (elaborating the test conditions into test cases) prioritize ==test cases==
- Test Implementation (prioritize ==test procedures==), ==test execution schedule==
### Whole Team Approach
==creates synergy== by allowing the various skill sets
### DevOps
==organizational approach== aiming to ==create synergy== by getting development and operation.
### Exhaustive testing is impossible
 * ==Testing everything is not feasible==
### SDLC
==abstract, high-level representation== of the software development process.
### Agile
==lightweight work product documentation== and ==extensive test automation==
### Acceptance test-driven development ATDD
A ==collaboration-based test-first approach== that defines *acceptance tests in the stakeholders'* domain language. 
### Retrospectives
==post-project meetings== end of a project or an iteration, at a release milestone, or can be held when needed
### Test Levels
==Group of Test activates== *organized and managed together* 
### Test Types
==Group of Test activates== related to *specific quality characteristics* 
### Functional testing
==what== the test object should do
### Non-functional testing
==how== well the system behaves
### Confirmation Testing 
- ==confirms that an original defect== has been successfully fixed
- No Money/Time: simply exercising the steps that should reproduce the failure caused by the defect
### Regression testing
- confirms that== ==no adverse consequences==
-  may not be restricted to the test object itself
- regression testing is a ==strong candidate==for automation
- Impact analysis done before a change is made
### Maintenance Testing
- ==corrective, adaptive== to changes in the environment or improve performance or maintainability
- Impact analysis may be done before a change is made
### Static Testing
- No code execution (finds defects directly ==(No failures)==)
- ==evaluate the quality==
- Static testing may more easily detect defects
- applied for both verification and validation
- measure quality characteristics that are not dependent on executing code (e.g., maintainability),
### Moderator in Static Analysis Review
ensures the ==effective running of review meetings==

### Each Choice coverage
The ==simplest coverage criterion== in the case of ==multiple sets of partitions==
test cases to exercise each partition from each set of partitions at least once.
does not take into account combinations of partitions
